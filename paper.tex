	I would like to express my special thanks of gratitude to our supervisor
	\textbf{Kajari Bhattacharjeee}, teachers of our department \textbf{Sonali
	Gupta} and department head \textbf{Srijeeta Charkraborty}; as well as our
	principal ma'am \textbf{Dr. Mausumi Chatterjee} who gave us the golden
	opportunity to do this wonderful project on \textit{Brain tumor detection},
	which has also helped us in doing a lot of research and we came to know
	about many new things.

	We are really thankful to them.

	Secondly we would like to thank the incredible authors of the research
	papers in our references/citations for providing us with the information.
